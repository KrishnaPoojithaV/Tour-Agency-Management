# Tour-Agency-Management
This management system has been designed in order to suggest destinations, book buses and
recommend accommodation, if required.
This system is divided into 2 modules, namely, User and Admin modules.

The system provides the user with options for their desired destination on the basis of nature of
trip, duration of trip and the distance. This system offers the choices of buses and user is
allowed to book bus according to the time. The destination details along with reviews are given
to the user. To book the bus tickets, the system connects to the travels and chooses the required
bus and books it. Moreover, cancellation of tickets is provided as an additional feature of this
management system.

The management also allows the bus coordinator to change the fare of the bus. It also lets the
bus operator to add a new bus to the system.
